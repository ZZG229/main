By: `T12-2`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819-T12-2/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `AddressBookModel` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `AddressBookModel` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI comprises two main interfaces:

* MainWindow: Supports patient information management
* ScheduleMainWindow: Supports appointment management

`MainWindow` is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel`
 etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

`ScheduleMainWindow` consists of parts as well, including its own copy of `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
and a `ScheduleListPanel`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
 in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
 link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
 link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in a `Model` (Either `AddressBookModel` or `ScheduleModel`) so that the UI can auto-update
when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP addressBookModel, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a addressBookModel may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== On-the-fly Switching between Modes

==== Current Implementation

This feature enables the software to separate patient information from appointment information clearly. The two modes
are `patient management mode` and `appointment management mode`. Users can switch between one mode to the other mode using
`mode command`. In addition, the feature supports auto-switch function. In other words, when user type in a valid command
(add, delete, select, find or edit) to manipulate appointments in patient mode, the software will switch to appointment
mode automatically, and vice versa.

The switching feature is mainly implemented using the eventbus and subscriber approach. The main logic of the switch is
implemented inside the UiManager class.The UiManager class maintains an instance of each patient mode window and appointment
mode window and each has an unique stage. When the software is initialised, both windows are initialised, but only the
patient window is shown as it is the default mode.

There are three steps involved in the processing of the switch feature:

Step 1. Event Post: When user types in a `mode command`,the ModeCommand will post a switchToPatientEvent or
SwitchToAppointmentEvent to the event center.

Step 2. Event Handle: UiManager is registered as an event handler. It subscribes from the events center and call
relevant method (switchToPatient or switchToAppointment).

Step 3. Handle Switch: Inside the switch methods, the current window will be hided and the other window will be shown.

[NOTE]
The implementation allows the window to know whether it is at the showing state. This is mainly to solve the problem
that help window is initialised from both windows when `help command` is called. Hence, when switch methods are called,
the showing state of the windows should also be updated. In addition, the feature that each window knows its showing
state is also helpful for future refinements.

The auto-switch feature is implemented using similar approach. When a valid command is executed, a event is posted to the
event center to switch to the corresponding mode. The way switch method is implemented allows the current showing window
not to be checked. For now, when user switch from patient mode to patient mode, the method will still be called but
it does not reflect any change in the UI. One way to refine is to allow software to check the current showing state and
if user switch from one mode to the same mode, an exception will be thrown. This implementation is, however, not very necessary.

.Sequence diagram when user inputs "mode appointment"
image::mode_command_sequence.PNG[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Switching mode or switching panel
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Having an entire set of UI, in this case `Appointment Main Window`to hold the
appointment related data.
** Pros: It is more flexible for future change. It would be easier to add more modes in the future if needed.
The design of the UI for various modes can be modified because they are independent from one another.
** Cons: It is more difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2 :** Only adding in an appointment panel and switching the panel if necessary.
** Pros:It is easier to implement.
** Cons: The program would be constrained if more modes are to be added in the future.

===== Aspect: Execution of mode command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Posting the switch mode event regardless of the current mode that user is in.
** Pros: The logic do not have to be aware of the UI component and hence reduce coupling.
** Cons: Users can switch from one mode to the same mode.
* **Alternative 2 :** The mode command maintains an instance of the UiManager and keep tracks of the current window
that is showing. When user requires to switch mode, identifies the current mode and generate exception if the user is
already in this mode.
** Pros: It can respond more accurately when user wish to switch mode.
** Cons: It increases dependency on the code unnecessarily.

=== Natural Language Processing for Adding an Appointment

==== Current Implementation

This feature facilitates scheduling, which enables the user to add appointments into the schedule system with user input phrased in natural expressions, and does so in a conversational process enabled by several prompt windows. It mainly implements a `ScheduleEvent` parser which parses natural language user input, and creates the intended `ScheduleEvent` object to be stored.

There are five steps involved in the processing of this feature:

Step 1. Breaking Down: User input is broken down into sub-fields, namely, patient and time.

Step 2. Patient Parsing:  User input for patient is parsed into the corresponding `PersonId` object.

Step 3. Time Parsing:  User input for time is parsed into a `Pair<Calendar>` object.

Step 4. Further Prompting: User is prompted with two prompt windows where tags and additional notes can be added.

Step 5. Generating Appointment: The resulting `ScheduleEvent` object corresponding to all user input is created.

The following is an example of a use case, and how the mechanism behaves:

User Input: `add appointment for David Lee next week`.

Step 1. Breaking Down: The user input string, starting with `for`, is passed into a `ScheduleEventParser` object, and broken down into meaningful substrings for patient and time respectively:

.. Programme starts with assuming that the substring for identifying the patient is only one word long, and the remaining string following that one word all the way to the end of the string is the input for time. In this case, `David` is the assumed patient substring and `Lee next week` is the assumed time substring.
.. Programme takes the assumed time substring,`Lee next week`, and checks if it is a valid time expression.
.. As a match cannot be found, it means that the assumed demarcation between patient and time inputs is incorrect. Programme makes another attempt by assuming the patient substring is longer by one word (i.e. `David Lee`) and the time substring is shorter by one word (i.e. `next week`). It takes the new assumed time substring and checks its validity again.
.. As a match is found this time, it indicates that the assumption is correct. `David Lee` will be carried forward to the Patient Parsing step while `next week` will be carried forward to the Time Parsing step.
.. In other cases where a match cannot be found after all assumptions have been tested, an exception will be thrown indicating that the user has not used an accepted expression.

The activity diagram below illustrates this process:

image::breakDownInputActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. Patient Parsing: The string `David Lee` is parsed and converted into the corresponding `PersonId` object:

.. Programme uses this string as the search string to create a new `MatchPersonPredicate` object which is then used to filter the list of patients.
.. If only one patient can be matched, the `PersonId` of the patient is immediately returned.
.. If multiple patients can be matched, programme passes the list of matched patients as a `String` into a `Prompt` object, where the list is displayed to the user in a `PromptWindow`. User is expected to enter the ID of the intended patient. The `PersonID` of the final intended patient is returned.

Step 3. Time Parsing: The string `next week` is passed to a `DateTimeParser` object where it is parsed and converted into a `Pair<Calendar>` object to represent the user's chosen time slot for the appointment:

.. Programme executes a keyword search and invokes the method `getWeekDates(currentTime, 1)`, where it converts `next week` into a datetime range, by doing relevant calculations on the `Calendar` object which represents the current time. For instance, if the command is executed on 16/10/2018, `next week` becomes a datetime range from 22/10/2018 09:00 - 28/10/2018 18:00. This range takes into consideration the doctor's working hours.
.. Programme searches the list of already scheduled appointments within the datetime range obtained. It finds a list of available time periods by taking the complement within that range (taking into consideration the doctor's working hours), and passes the list as a `String` into a `Prompt` object, where the list is displayed to the user in a `PromptWindow`.
.. User inputs a specific time slot from the list of available time periods. For instance, user inputs `22/10/2018 09:00 - 10:00`. The refined time slot string is then passed back to `DateTimeParser` and converted into a `Pair<Calendar>` object that represents this time slot, by invoking the method `parseTimeSlot(timeSlotString)`.

Step 4. Further Prompting: The user is presented with two more `PromptWindow`, where they can provide further inputs for tagsand additional notes for the appointment. This is done through a simple I/O mechanism.

Step 5. Generating Appointment: Results from the previous steps are used to fill the attributes of a newly created `ScheduleEvent` object which is then returned.


The sequence diagram below summarises this feature, showing notable steps. Note that step 4 and 5 are omitted in the diagram as they are relatively trivial:

image::NaturalLanguageProcessingSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Abstraction over time slot

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `Pair<Calendar>` where the `key` and `value` represent the start time and end time of a time slot respectively.
** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: `key` and `value` are not intuitive in this context, hence it is difficult for other developers to understand.
* **Alternative 2:** Define a `Duration` class which has the `Pair<Calendar>` as an attribute, providing an additional layer of abstraction.
** Pros: It is easy for new developers to understand the context by defining methods such as `getStartTime()`, at the same time not exposing the internal implementation.
** Cons: Defining this class may be not worth the effort as it has only one use case (as an attribute in `ScheduleEvent`) in the application.

===== Aspect: Algorithm to find available time slots given a list of already scheduled appointments in an interval

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Loop through the list of appointments twice. The first time is to find available time slots in days where there are scheduled appointments. The second time is to find completely free days. The code snippets show the two loops.

    private List<Pair<Calendar>> getAvailableSlotList(List<ScheduleEvent> scheduledAppts, Pair<Calendar> dateInterval) {
        // ...
        for (int i = 0; i < scheduledAppts.size() - 1; i++) {
            // ...
            findAvailableSlotsBetweenTwoAppts(availableSlots, currentEnd, nextStart);
        }
        // ...
        findCompletelyAvailableDays(scheduledAppts, dateInterval, availableSlots);
    }

    private void findCompletelyAvailableDays(List<ScheduleEvent> scheduledAppts, Pair<Calendar> dateInterval, List<Pair<Calendar>> availableSlots) {
        // ...
        for (ScheduleEvent appt: scheduledAppts) {
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }

** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: Performance is adversely affected because the list has to be searched through twice.
* **Alternative 2:** Keep a day pointer and loop through the list of appointments only once to find all available time slots.
** Pros: It enhances performance because the list is searched through only once.
** Cons: It is harder to implement, due to the difficulties in manipulating `java.util.Calendar` as a day pointer. Edge cases such as crossing the year boundaries are difficult to handle.

// tag::diagnosis[]
=== Diagnosis

==== Current Implementation

The diagnosis feature is facilitated by `Diagnosis` class. This class contains a private attribute called
`matcher` of type `HashMap<Disease, Set<Symptom>>`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Diagnosis#hasDisease(Disease disease)` – Check if the application contains the `disease` input by users
* `Diagnosis#getSymptoms(Disease disease)` – Return a `list` of all the related `symptoms` of a `disease` input by users
* `Diagnosis#getDiseases()` – Return a `list` of existing `diseases` from the database
* `Diagnosis#addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)` – Store a particular `disease` with its set of `symptoms` in database.
* `Diagnosis#predictDisease(Set<Symptom> symptoms)` – Predict a `disease` for a set of `symptoms` input by users.

These operations are exposed in the `DiagnosisModel` interface as
`DiagnosisModel# hasDisease(Disease disease)`,
`DiagnosisModel#getSymptoms(Disease disease)`, `DiagnosisModel#getDiseases()`,
`DiagnosisModel#addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)` and
`DiagnosisModel#predictDisease(Set<Symptom> symptoms)` respectively.

.Diagnosis Class Diagram
image::DiagnosisClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `diagnosis` mechanism behaves at each step:

.Sequence Diagram
image::DiagnosisSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Diagnosis` will be instantiated and its
private attribute `matcher` will be initialized by calling the `static` method `Diagnosis#readDataFromCsvFile()`.

Step 2. The user executes `find disease Influenza` command to get symptoms of “Influenza” stored in the patient book.
The `find disease` command calls `DiagnosisModel#hasDisease(Disease disease)` first, if the return `Boolean` value is `false`,
the user will be notified with a `command exception` thrown . If the return value is `true`, it will continue to call
`DiagnosisModel#getSymptoms(Disease disease)` and get all the `symptoms` related to “Influenza” in a `List<Symptom>`.

Step 3. If the disease is not present in the database record, the user can execute
`add disease d/Influenza s/ncoordination s/fever s/pleuritic pain…` command to insert the data into the database record.
Now, the `add disease` command calls `DiagnosisModel#addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)`.
Now it will call the `static` method `writeDataFromCsvFile(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)` which returns
a `Hashmap` of type `HashMap<Disease, Set<Symptom>>` and assigns it to `this.matcher` to update the `private` attribute.

Step 4. The user executes `list disease` command to get a list of diseases stored in the patient book.
The `list disease` command calls `DiagnosisModel#getDiseases()` which returns a `list` of diseases present in the
`key set of matcher`.

Step 5. Now the user decides to execute the command `predict` to search for a `disease` in database that
matches with input symptoms. This command calls `DiasnosisModel#predictDisease(Set<Symptom>)` which returns a `list`
of diseases that are mapped to a set of symptoms containing the given set.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Disease-symptom matching data structures

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `HashMap` where the `key` and `value` are the disease and set of
related symptoms respectively.
** Pros: Better performance in terms of efficiency; duplicate values are also eliminated.
** Cons: Difficult for other developers to understand.
* **Alternative 2:** Define a `Match` class with two private attributes representing the disease and a set of
related symptoms, then maintain a `list` of `Match` objects.
** Pros: Easy for new developers to understand when disease-symptom pairs are encapsulated in an object.
** Cons: May take up more memory, leading to performance issues.

===== Aspect: Searching algorithm to support disease prediction operation

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `stream` to search and collect all potential diseases.
** Pros: Easy to implement and easy for new developers to understand.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of lower efficiency.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a more systematic way to determine the suitability of each disease by
calculating the similarity of its pre-existing set of symptoms and the set of symptoms given by users.
** Pros: More accurate in determining the correct diseases.
** Cons: Hard to implement and understand.

// end::diagnosis[]

// tag::delete[]
=== Deletion of Entries from Working Dataset

==== Current Implementation

Instances of `Person` are currently being deleted via soft-delete: setting the instance variable `exists` to `false`.

Instances of `ScheduleEvent` are currently being deleted directly: removing the objects themselves altogether from the
data structure encapsulated within `Schedule`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Deletion of Person or ScheduleEvent Entries

* **Alternative 1:** Deletion is accomplished via soft-delete.
** This was chosen for deleting patients from the address book in order to ensure that a patient can never be permanently removed. Preventing deletion ensures that even deceased patients may have their information accessed, and guarantees that accidental deletion will never lead to important patient data being lost. Implementation is done via the addition of an `exists` field in the Person class.
** Using this approach for deleting appointments from the schedule will work but is unnecessary as appointment information is not nearly as sensitive as patient data.
* **Alternative 2:** Person deletion is accomplished via actual deletion from the person list.
** Patient data is no longer recoverable after deletion (unless undo/redo is implemented). This is the approach chosen for deleting appointments from the schedule instead, since this information may easily be recovered and is not nearly as sensitive as a patient's medical information.
// end::delete[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo (Coming in v2.0)

==== Proposed Implementation

Undo/Redo is accomplished using `VersionedAddressBook` and `VersionedSchedule`. This is encapsulated in the
`ApplicationDataState` class.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect : How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book and schedule.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person or event being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book and schedule states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update `HistoryManager`, `VersionedSchedule` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Drug Database Search

This feature allows the user to view pharmacological information about medical drugs currently licensed for sale
in Singapore. It has been partially implemented, but remains in the form of unused code modules at this time.

==== Currently Implemented

The implementation is contained within a single code module, "DrugSearchUtility.java",
which accesses a static database stored in "datasetForDrugs.csv", formatted in UTF-8.

The database contains several categories of pharmacological metadata about each medical drug licensed for
sale in Singapore as of September, 2018.

The feature has been implemented using the OpenCSV library, which offers tools for manipulating
.csv (Comma Separated Values) files.

A keyword is provided by the user as input to the `search()` function of the program.
This input keyword is first matched against a predetermined set of "generic" keywords which occur
very commonly in the names of drugs, and would therefore make for an unsuitable search query
(as it would match tens or even hundreds of drugs). For example,
they keywords "tablet" or "injection" would be rejected as search queries,
because they would produce hundreds of results.

If the keyword passes the above check, it is then iteratively compared against all the
entries in the drug database, and metadata of the drugs whose names contain the keyword
are added to a cache.

Finally certain metadata about each of the cached drugs - Name, Classification and Active Ingredients -
are appended successively to a String, and the String is returned. Along with each drug, a message
is also appended indicating the drug's index in the cache, allowing the user to enter
another command (referring to the index number of a particular search result) in order
to see the entire pharmacological data (seven categories) for that particular drug. This has
been done to ensure that search results are not excessively long and verbose.

The cache is flushed at the initiation of a new search.

==== To Be Implemented

*Commands:* Commands for accessing the database have yet to be incorporated into the program.

These commands will be `drug [keyword]` (to query the database for drugs matching
the given keyword, and `moreinfo [index]` (to view full pharmacological metadata about
any drug from the search results).

*Link With Symptom Matcher:* The feature may be integrated with the Symptom Matching feature,
allowing the user to see recommended prescriptions for a given symptom.

*Logging And Exception Handling:* The feature currently has it's own log file for errors. This will be modified so
as to use the integrated central logging feature in Patient Book as a whole. Exception handling
will be modified in this way too.








== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `addressBookModel`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the addressBookModel API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to addressBookModel component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

==== Full Solution

See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/599[PR] for the step-by-step solution.
